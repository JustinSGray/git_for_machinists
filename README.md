## What is git + github? 
A version control system mainly designed for text documents (any file type that is made up of ascii or unicode txt)

Anything that looks like a txt file:

You can also keep non txt files in the repo, like PDFs and image files.
These can sometimes be useful too, but aren't the main purpose of git or github.
